**Why Python?**

- It's a programming language - doesn't matter
- Alternatives for science: Matlab, Mathematica, Julia, R, SAS
- Alternatives for data science: Scala, JavaScript, Go
- Widely used in science / research
  - Good for interactive computing and literate programming
- Widely used outside of science (web platforms, data science)
- Number 1 on TIOBE popularity index (Python, C, C++), https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/
- What else: huge active community, many scientific libraries, high level, open
- Some drawbacks (reproducibility, incompatibilities, bit of a mess, wild west libraries)
- What do your colleagues use?

**Data**

- Data location: https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/files/python-novice-gapminder-data.zip
- Download the data and unzip
- Determine where the data is located
- Open up Jupyter lab in the directory one directory down from the data files
